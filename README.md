# Starfish

**An AI ops engineer for teams that don't have one.**

Starfish watches a production Firebase/GCP project, judges which incidents are actually
urgent, drafts a fix, adversarially reviews its own work, and opens a verified pull request
— then stops and waits for a human.

Named for the animal that regrows what it loses.

---

## Why

Sentry's Seer needs Sentry and a team around it. Google's Gemini Cloud Assist is built for
enterprises that already employ SREs. Both assume an engineering organisation exists.

Nobody builds for the two-person company running real production for real users — which is
the long tail of most software that actually matters to the people using it.

That's the gap Starfish is for.

## Design goal: configured, never forked

Starfish is meant to be **generic** — one engine, pointed at different projects by
configuration alone. The test is deliberately falsifiable:

> **Nobody should have to edit `src/` to run Starfish against their own project.**

Everything deployment-specific belongs in `src/config.ts` and nowhere else. If adopting
Starfish somewhere new requires touching engine code, that's a bug in the design, not a
missing feature.

Where it currently holds, and where it doesn't:

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Service attribution | ✅ config patterns — no hardcoded service list |
| Project, environment, collection, database, lookback | ✅ config (engine `src/config.ts`, UI `web/src/lib/config.ts`) |
| Collection names in `firestore.rules` | ⚠️ hardcoded `incidents` / `starfish_users`; rules can't read config, so a renamed collection means editing the rules file |
| Log source resource types | ⚠️ config, but attribution reads only `function_name` / `service_name`, so only Cloud Functions and Cloud Run work |
| Framework-noise suppression list | ✅ config, callable GET-probe noise by default |
| Incident store | ❌ assumes Firestore |
| Verify-gate command | ❌ not built yet — must be config when it is |

The ❌ rows are tracked work, not accepted limitations.

## Known blind spot: logs are not the only signal

Ingestion reads Cloud Logging only. The production pipeline this ingest is adapted from found that
Firebase **gen2** (Cloud Run) functions can fail without emitting an ERROR-severity log at
all: a log-only reader then reports "no errors" while Cloud Monitoring still counts the
failed invocations. The fix there was a second, Monitoring-derived source feeding the same
store. Starfish does not have that yet, so until it does, a clean ingest run means *no
logged errors*, not *no errors*.

## How it works

```
Cloud Logging  ──▶  incident store  ──▶  Gemini triage      "is this actually urgent?"
                    (fingerprint,          │
                     occurrence count,     ▼
                     counter-check)      Gemini fix-draft   "what's the minimal patch?"
                                           │
                                           ▼
                                         verify gate        lint · typecheck · test · build
                                           │                (deterministic — NOT the model)
                                           ▼
                                         Gemini review      adversarial: try to break it
                                           │
                                           ▼
                                         pull request       ← stops here. A human merges.
```

The verify gate is deliberately *not* an LLM. The model proposes; the test suite disposes.

## The trust ladder

Writing a fix is the easy part. Knowing when it's allowed to act is the hard part.

Today Starfish never merges and never deploys. The direction is to **merge what it can prove
is safe and escalate the rest**: rung 4 is scoped to classes with low blast radius and
structural certainty, such as a missing composite index, starting with the demo project. That
is decided in [`docs/design/auto-merge-policy.md`](docs/design/auto-merge-policy.md) and
**not built yet**.
Autonomy is earned in stages, not switched on:

| Rung | Guardrail | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | Full verify gate on every patch | designed |
| 0 | Adversarial self-review before a human sees it | designed |
| 0 | Human-gated stop at PR — never merges, never deploys | designed |
| 1 | Integration-suite re-run required for merge eligibility | planned |
| 2 | End-to-end coverage of the affected user flow | planned |
| 3 | Blast-radius limits + rollback/canary story | planned |
| 4 | Scoped auto-merge: low blast radius **and** proven cause (policy written) | blocked on 1–3 |

Each rung is a prerequisite for the next. Rung 4 is not a switch we get to flip on our own.

## Status

Early, but not from scratch. The ingestion half is adapted from an incident pipeline the
authors run in production for their own product: Cloud Logging query and false-positive suppression, error
classification, fingerprint dedup, rolling occurrence buckets, PII redaction. Most of its
apparent over-engineering is scar tissue from real incidents, and the tests in
`src/ingest/ingest.test.ts` pin the behaviours that were learned the expensive way:

- classification trusts what the source asserted before guessing from message text
- an unattributable function resolves to `"platform"` — never to whichever service is
  listed first, which is a real bug that mislabelled alerts for weeks
- audit logs and callable-framework GET probes are dropped at both query and parse time
- a resolved incident is never reopened; a recurrence opens a fresh one
- an open incident is found by its fingerprint, so a busy function's burst can't fork one
  incident into several (`store.test.ts`)
- a log's `error` field is kept apart from its title: the title keys the fingerprint, the
  error is the cause a fixer needs

Alongside it, the **counter-check** (`src/ingest/counterCheck.ts`): an independent raw-log
recount of a function's errors over 24h, plus a few redacted recent samples. It is built for
triage to use and not yet wired in, because triage doesn't exist yet. The spike's triage
prompt already reasons over it.

What does **not** exist yet is the half that acts: triage, fix drafting, the verify gate,
adversarial review. That is the work, and it is gated on one question the
[spike](docs/spike.md) exists to answer — does Gemini actually produce the patch a human
wrote?

## Development

```bash
pnpm install            # also points git at .githooks/
cp .env.example .env    # set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
pnpm run verify         # the gate: lint · typecheck · test · build
pnpm test:rules         # firestore.rules on the emulator (needs Java)
pnpm -C web dev         # operator UI on :5177 (copy web/.env.example to web/.env)
pnpm dev:emulated       # the UI against seeded local emulators, no GCP project needed
pnpm spike              # fix-quality spike (needs Vertex AI access)
```

Requires Node 22+ and a GCP project with the Vertex AI API enabled. Starfish keeps its
incident store in its own Firestore database, `starfish`, so its rules and indexes never
touch your app's database. Create it once (`gcloud firestore databases create
--database=starfish --location=<region>`), then `firebase deploy --only firestore` deploys
`firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json` to that database alone.

Starfish is built with AI-assisted development (Claude Code); the git hooks, verify gate,
Claude Code hooks and skills live in the repo, with `CLAUDE.md` as the entry point. The
product itself runs on Gemini.
